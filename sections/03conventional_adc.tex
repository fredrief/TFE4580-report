\chapter{Conventional A/D conversion}
\label{sec:conventional_adc}
Conventional A/D converters can generally be divided into two main categories; Nyquist rate- and oversampling converters.

\section{Nyquist Converters}
\label{subsec:nyquist_adc}
The classical approach to A/D conversion is to divide the conversion problem into two parts; sampling and quantization.

\section{Oversampling converters}
\label{subsec:oversampling_adc}
Robustness by introducing redundancy in the form of oversampling. Oversampling ration refers to the nyquist rate and defined by
\begin{equation}
    \text{OSR} = \frac{f_s}{2f_0}
\end{equation}

Straight-forward oversampling itself gives an advantage 3dB per doubling of OSR.

By introducing a feedback path with a loop filter, less error and better resolution can be obtained in a certain frequency band. Effect known as noise shaping. Such a system is known as a \sdmod. A discrete time \sdmod is shown in figure \ref{fig:dtsdmod}.

\end{figure}

A continuous time \sdmod is achieved by including the sampling in the feedback loop. In this case, the anti-aliasing filter is part of loop filter $G(e^{j\Omega})$. A continuous time \sdmod is shown in figure \ref{fig:ctsdmod}.
