\chapter{Conventional A/D conversion}
\label{sec:conventional_adc}
In order to highlight how a control-bounded converter distinguishes from conventional A/D converters, some fundamentals of conventional A/D conversion is included in this chapter. Conventional A/D converters can generally be divided into two main categories; Nyquist rate- and oversampling converters. In the classical approach, the conversion problem is divided into sampling and quantization, and the main difference between the Nyquist rate and the oversampling converters is the frequency of the sampling. The two types of converters will be described briefly in the following sections.

\section{Nyquist Converters}

\section{Oversampling converters}
\label{subsec:oversampling_adc}
Robustness by introducing redundancy in the form of oversampling. Oversampling ration refers to the nyquist rate and defined by
\begin{equation}
    \text{OSR} = \frac{f_s}{2f_0}
\end{equation}

Straight-forward oversampling itself gives an advantage 3dB per doubling of OSR.

By introducing a feedback path with a loop filter, less error and better resolution can be obtained in a certain frequency band. Effect known as noise shaping. Such a system is known as a \sdmod. A discrete time \sdmod is shown in figure \ref{fig:dtsdmod}.

\end{figure}

A continuous time \sdmod is achieved by including the sampling in the feedback loop. In this case, the anti-aliasing filter is part of loop filter $G(e^{j\Omega})$. A continuous time \sdmod is shown in figure \ref{fig:ctsdmod}.
