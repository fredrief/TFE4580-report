\chapter{Hadamard ADC}
\label{sec:HadamardADC}

The main advantage of control-bounded ADCs is flexibility. The only requirement set on the system by the estimation filter is that the it obeys the differential equations (\ref{eq:state_space_equations}). This flexibility allows the designer to taylor the system against the application to a larger degree than what is possible in conventional ADC.

The application of this work is modern high-end ultrasound probes. Such probes has up to 10,000 transducers stacked in a 2D array, and the large number of transducers is used for beamforming. With todays technology, having 10,000 ADCs inside the probe is not possible due to restrictions on area and current consumption. Todays solutions therefore employ combinations of analog and digital beamforming, dividing the transducer array into sub arrays sharing one ADC. The transducers of each sub array are combined with analog delay-and-add techniques. Having full control of each transducer would of course be favorable.

In this work, we want to take advantage of this large number of input channels. Instead of converting each channel individually we view the problem of converting 10,000 analog signals as one big task, resulting in one huge ADC instead of 10,000 smaller ones. The goal is that the resulting ADC will have a current consumption less than 10,000 times a single state-of-the-art ADC.

The Hadamard ADC is based on the chain-of-integrator ADC and apply the Hadamard matrix, $\Hn{N}$, to rotate the state vector of the analog system. For N being powers of two, the Hadamard matrix is defined recursively as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defn}
    \Hn{N} = \Hn{2} \otimes \Hn{\nicefrac{N}{2}}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:def2}
    \Hn{2} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The Hadamard matrix is an orthogonal matrix with the useful properties
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Hmat_symmetry}
    \Hn{N} = \Tr{\Hn{N}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Hmat_inverse}
    \Tr{\Hn{N}}\Hn{N} = N\eyen{N}.
\end{equation}

When transforming the state vector, the energy from all input channels will be equally distributed over all involved components. The consequence of this is that the overall ADC can be scaled towards the average, rather than the maximum signal energy. Depending on the spatial peak-to-average ration of the input channels, this will result in a gain of SNR, as will be further explored the next chapter.

\section{Analog System}
The Hadamard ADC is described by the equations
\begin{align}
    \dot{\bm{x}}(t) & = \Amat \xtv + \Bmat \utv + \Gmat \stv \\
    \ytv & = \CmatT \xtv
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
    \stvtilde & = \GmattildeT \xtv.
\end{align}

The AS is determined solely by $\Amat, \Bmat$ and $\CmatT$. $\Gmat$ and $\GmattildeT$ only affects the performance of the DC which will be described in the next section. The state-space matrices $\Amat, \Bmat$ and $\CmatT$ must be chosen such that the desired state-vector rotation is obtained, and at the same time provide high gain within the frequency band of interest. In addition, the parametrization should allow an energy efficient hardware implementation.

The proposed system is described by
\begin{align}
    \Amat & = \bm{H}'_N \Amat' \label{eq:AH_def} \in \R^{N \times N}, \\
    \Bmat & = \bm{H}'_N \Bmat' \label{eq:BH_def} \in \R^{N \times L}
\end{align}
and

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:def_Cmat}
    \Cmat = \Cmat' \in \R^{N \times L},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defn_}
    \bm{H}'_N =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Hn{\nicefrac{N}{2}} & \bm{0}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}} \\
        \bm{0}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}} & \Hn{\nicefrac{N}{2}}
    \end{bmatrix} \in \R^{N \times N}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:def_AH_}
    \Amat' =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{0}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}} & \beta \bm{L}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}} \\
        \beta \eyen{\nicefrac{N}{2}} & \bm{0}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}}
    \end{bmatrix} \in \R^{N \times N}.
\end{equation}

The matrix $\Amat'$ is described as a block matrix and the sub-matrix $\Amat_{21} = \beta \bm{L}_{\nicefrac{N}{2}}$ is a strictly lower triangular matrix. For the single input case,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:def_Lmat}
    \Lmatn{\nicefrac{N}{2}} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 & 0 & \\
        0 & 1 & 0 \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\
        0 & \cdots & 0 & 1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \in \R^{\frac{N}{2} \times \frac{N}{2}},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Bmat' =
    \Tr{\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & \cdots & 0
    \end{pmatrix}}
    \in \R^{N \times L}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \Cmat' =
    \Tr{\begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
    \end{pmatrix}}
    \in \R^{N \times L}.
\end{equation}
Note that $\Cmat$ only determines which states of the AS that is considered as an output by the DE. Thus it is a purely conceptual matrix with no physical implementation. With this choice of $\Cmat$, only the last state of the AS is treated as an output. It is also possible to consider multiple outputs and this will indeed give increased performance. However, for simplicity, only the single output case is treated in this report.

For the multiple input case, i.e. $L>1$, we define $N = L N_\ell$, where $N_\ell$ is the order of the single input system. Due to the shape of the parametrization matrices, we restrict both $N_\ell$ and $L$ to be powers of 2. For $L>1$, the state-space matrices generalizes as
\begin{equation}
    \Lmatn{\nicefrac{N}{2}} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Lmatn{\nicefrac{N_\ell}{2}} \\
        &  \ddots & \\
        & & \Lmatn{\nicefrac{N_\ell}{2}}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \in \R^{\frac{N}{2} \times \frac{N}{2}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Bmat' =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Bmat'_\ell \\
        &  \ddots & \\
        & & \Bmat'_\ell
    \end{bmatrix}
    \in \R^{N \times L}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \Cmat' =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \Cmat'_\ell \\
        &  \ddots & \\
        & & \Cmat'_\ell
    \end{bmatrix}
    \in \R^{N \times L}.
\end{equation}
With $N=LN_\ell$ and $\Lmatn{\nicefrac{N}{2}}$ as above, $\Amat, \Bmat$ and $\CmatT$ is still given by (\ref{eq:AH_def})-(\ref{eq:def_Cmat}).
In this single output case, the transfer function is a column vector given by
\begin{align}
    \bm{G}(\omega) & = \CmatT \left( j\omega \eyen{N} - \Amat \right)^{-1} \Bmat \\
                   & = \CmatT \left( j\omega \eyen{N} - \Hn{N}' \Amat' \right)^{-1} \Hn{N}' \Bmat',
\end{align}
where each element gives the transfer function of the corresponding input. It is shown in appendix \ref{a:tf_analysis} that all inputs will have the same transfer function, given by
\begin{equation}
    G(\omega) = \left( \sqrt{\frac{N}{2}}\frac{\beta}{j\omega} \right)^{N_\ell}
\end{equation}


A hardware implementation of the proposed AS is shown in figure \ref{fig:HCI_AS_01} for $N=8$ and $L=2$. For this example, $\Amat$ is given by
\begin{align}
    \Amat & = \bm{H}'_8 \Amat' \\  & =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & -1 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \beta & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \beta & 0 \\
        \beta & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \beta & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & \beta & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \beta & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}
The Hadamard matrices $\Hn{4}(Z)$ is easily implemented as shown in figure \ref{fig:H4Z}. The integrators can be implemented using either operational voltage- or transconductance amplifiers.
